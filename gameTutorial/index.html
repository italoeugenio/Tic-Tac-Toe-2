          <h2>1. The Big Picture</h2>
          <p>
            I think you know about regular Tic Tac Toe, so I won't explain the
            basics.
            <br /><br />
            Imagine you have <strong>9 small games</strong> inside one giant
            board. To win the match, you don't just need 3 cells in a row; you
            need to win <strong>3 small boards</strong> in a row (horizontal,
            vertical, or diagonal).

          <h2>2. How to Move? (The Trap)</h2>
          <p>
            You don't choose which board to play on! Your move dictates your
            opponent's next turn.
            <br /><br />
            If you place your mark in the <strong>bottom-right cell</strong> of
            a small board, your opponent is forced to play in the
            <strong>bottom-right board</strong>.

          <h2>3. Free Move</h2>
          <p>
            What happens if your opponent sends you to a board that is
            <strong>already finished</strong>? <br /><br />
            You get a <strong>Free Move</strong>! You can choose to play in
            <strong>any</strong>
            of the available boards. This is a huge strategic advantage.

          <h2>4. The Draw Rule (Joker)</h2>
          <p>
            If a small board ends in a tie (no winner), it becomes a
            <strong>Joker</strong>. <br /><br />
            This means the board counts as a point for
            <strong>BOTH</strong> players when checking for the final victory.
            Don't underestimate a draw!
